      <p>By now I’m sure you’ve gathered that I may be a bit of a nerd.</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>Born and raised in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. I'm the youngest of 4 children, all girls, I can imagine what you are thinking. Yes, my father was totally outnumbered. I'm fully fluent in both Spanish and English. Being that Spanish is the main language spoken in Puerto Rico, I was able to learn English in school and watching TV. I went to college just like many people but halfway through it I just quit. It wasn't until I become older I realized the importance of having an education. It was't until recently that I went back to school to complete my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I'm hoping in the future I will pursue getting my Master's degree.</p>

      <p>Another interesting fact, in November of 2006 I joined in the military. As of today, I'm the first and only female from my immediate and extended family to have served. I joined the Army as a Signal Support System Specialit, which in civilian terms is handling the communications and information systems support for the armed forces. Being able to serve my country I feel has been one of the must selfless things I have ever done. After leaving the military in 2010 I re-joined the work force to work as a Network Engineer for a major wireless company. Ten years after being in the telecommunications industry I decided I needed a change. I recently joined Amazon as a Software Development Engineer apprentice. This marks a new journey in my life and I'm looking forward to what this new adventure will bring.</p>

      <p>I have created this page to share a little bit more about me and my interests. Hope you enjoy it! If you do please drop us a line we would love to hear from you.</p>
