      <h1>About Korean Dramas</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <p>Korean dramas are more popularly knwon as K-dramas. K-dramas, are television series in the Korean language,
        made in South Korea. Watching K-dramas is like living another life that is full of charming characters and
        different plot twists. You will get thriller, comedy, suspense, charming characters, some superficial
        characters, and lots of Korean food and fashion in one drama. They have grown in popularity due to their
        widespread availability via streaming services which often offer subtitles in multiple languages. Generally,
        k-dramas don’t have more than 16 to 30 episodes. Most of them have only 16 episodes. This unique characteristic
        made dramas show more stories in less time.</p>
        
      <p>You may be asking yourself why to I like k-dramas? For me korean dramas successfully create emotional
        connections with viewers. Characters are developed and brought through trials and tribulations in such a way
        that the audience relates to the characters and feels the same emotions. Being able to experience something new
        is a given with K-dramas, what with the total immersion in Korean culture. We can pick up on some of the
        cultural nuances embedded into the dramas, like bowing and the different ways of respectfully addressing others.
        K-dramas also offer insight into key societal issues like bullying and intense pressure regarding education and
        appearance.You probably have heard about Squid Games, well that is a k-drama. The series revolves around a
        contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial debt, risk their lives to play a series of deadly
        children's games for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion prize. The title of the series draws from a similarly
        named Korean children's game.</p>

      <p>Here is a list of my top 5 K-dramas:</p>
      <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">Crash Landing on You</li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">Goblin (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God)</li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">Vincenzo</li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">The King: Eternal Monarch</li>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-dark">It's Okay to Not Be Okay</li>
      </ol>
