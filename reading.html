      <h1>About Reading</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <p>Reading started out as an interest but has definitely has become a hobby and a passion. What some people donâ€™t know is that reading can be creative even though it only involves receiving information without putting any input. It inspires the mind to make sense of the information in the best way possible. Reading can also help relieve stress. No matter how much stress you have at work, in your personal relationships, or countless other issues faced in daily life, it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story. A well-written novel can transport you to other realms, while an engaging article will distract you and keep you in the present moment, letting tensions drain away and allowing you to relax.</p>
        
      <p>Reading can be an inexpensive hobby as you can get books for free from your local library, second hand stores for fairly cheap, and even Amazon has a ton of e-books for free. But if you are like me that collects books and likes traveling to book conventions, then it can get very expensive. Right now my physical book collection is over 500 books and my e-book collection is in the thousands. Joining the book community has allowed me to meet people from over the world. I'm part of countless book groups where I have been able to make friends that I know will be in my life forever. While I haven't met most of this people in person, we talk over social media about our shared love of books. </p>
        
      <p>I have included my GoodReads link below. There you can see what I'm currently reading, some of my favorite books, and so much more. For those of you that don't know GoodReads is a social cataloging website. It allows users to generate library catalogs and readings lists. You can also search books, annotations, quotes, and reviews</p>
